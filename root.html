      <h2>Come on in.</h2>
      <p>This is the digital portfolio of Jade Rager, a full-stack student enrolled in the Codefellows training program.</p>
      <p>We're not living in the 210th decade any more. The web has quickly become a symbol of universal access to information.</p>
      <p><em>So shouldn't it be universally accessible, built with a wide array of mobile devices in mind?</em></p>
      <p>As a coder with deep interest in and passion for the internet, both as an indispensible tool for the modern human, and as a technology with vast and unexplored potential for the future, I think it should be.</p>
      <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
      <p>Smartphones. Tablets. Even desktop monitors may have a swivel mount.</p>
      <p><em>The web must be viewport-agnostic.</em></p>
      <p>It's a wonder that it ever wasn't - resizable windows are foundational to all desktop operating systems.</p>
      <p>Mobile is not a trend that can or should be stopped, and <a href=http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13881930/microsoft-turn-a-phone-into-a-pc-arm-continuum>certain developments</a> are blurring the markets between desktop and mobile even further.</p>

      <h2>About Jade:<br>A Personal Bio</h2>
      <p>I owe the better half of my most formative moments to the internet. phpBB messageboards, flash animations, and a virtual reality platform by the name of ActiveWorlds make up a sizable portion of the nostalgia pie.</p>
      <p>The allure of being able to create the very same things that I voraciously consumed was too much to resist as a child, and I made many forays into everything from HTML/CSS, to Python, Ruby, and even general-purpose application languages like Java and C++. Equipped with only online tutorials, my resources were limited then, and while I made quite a few demos, I never acquired the needed know-how to realize a major project. There is only so much an aspiring coder can do with a static, unscripted HTML page and a collection of command-line C++ applications. Servers? Backends? Databases? A bit out-of-reach for fourteen-year-old-me.</p>
      <p>Deterred but not defeated, I held tightly to the vision of myself as a technician and a creator. In truth, I couldn't let it go. That desire had taken root far too deeply to be dismissed, and it would not rest. I was already too enamored by the idea of being able to make things which solved problems no one else had before me, things that could be clever or even beautiful.</p>
      <p>So, it was difficult to be pushed by life in other directions, to have that longing unmet, when at my very core I had constructed my identity entirely around the premise that I was a coder, and placed all my hope into that future. The limitations on what I had available to me coupled with my apprehending the sheer scope of what I had to learn - unassisted - as a first-generation tech-worker in a rural backwater town did eventually set in, however...</p>
      <p>My first heartbreak was not with any person but with a calling. As happens with these stories, I awaited the day I could return to what I loved. (Aww!)</p>
      <p>Uncharacteristically for one of these stories, I did in fact re-unite with what I sought in the first place. My skillset is vastly broader than anything I knew before, and my younger self would likely be in awe or disbelief of what I've accomplished today. It's a nice chapter to stick your bookmark in, don't you think?</p>
